    <h1><b><u>About Me</u></b></h1>
    <p>My name is Kade Hunter, student #S3831036. I’ve lived in Wodonga for most of my life and currently work at a manufacturing plant that I’ve been employed at since 2012. I have two dogs, the oldest is a long-haired German shepherd named Storm, the youngest a golden retriever named Alby. My hobbies include playing basketball on Monday nights and mixed netball on Thursday nights, playing video games, cooking and going to the gym. My interest in Information Technology (IT) began when I was first in year 11 when I studied Vocational Education and Training (VET) IT. I enjoyed discovering the basics of programming and learning about how far the industry has come. My interest developed over time with my interest in building gaming PC’s, educating myself on what each piece of hardware is used in a computer. Additionally, my cousin completed his degree recently in Software Engineering at RMIT. I often discuss with him my interests in IT and we trade opinions on the potential future of different aspects of technology, he was a primary factor to why I decided to take up tertiary studies. I am currently studying Introduction to Information Technology which is my first subject towards completing my bachelor’s degree in IT. I am currently working on assignment 2 with my team “The A Team”.</p>
